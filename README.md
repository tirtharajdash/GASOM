## Language:
The GASOM software is written in Python. The GA implementation of the software is parallelized for efficiency.

## Dependencies:

  1. Pyevolve==0.6rc1
  2. matplotlib==2.0.0
  3. numpy==1.12.1
  4. pandas==0.18.1

## Setup:

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
2. Edit the params : datasetpath, number_of_columns_csv, features, dataset_name, type_of_problem, data
(Change data numpy array, so that, data contains only the relevant features, without the tags and indices)
3. python train.py > dataset.log (This gives the best possible SOM Map Size for your dataset)
4. Results will be present in dataset_name folder in cwd, along with final stats in dataset.log file. 
5. python generate_error_plot.py <pickle file in dataset_name folder> <dataset_name> (Error plot is generated)
6. Visualise the results

* Real World Data sets used:
	 
   1. Wine
   2. Iris
   3. Abalone
   4. Car Evaluation
   5. Glass Identification

* Synthetic Data sets used:
 
   1. Corner
   2. CrescentFullMoon
   3. Ginger Breadman
   4. Half Kernal
   5. Outliers
   6. Two Spirals
